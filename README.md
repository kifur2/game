## Description:
"3D First Person Shooter" is an action-packed game where the player navigates an infinite map, tasked with defeating endless waves of enemies. Each successive wave grows in difficulty and number, challenging the player to survive as long as possible.

## Key Features:
The game offers smooth and responsive player movement for an immersive experience. Players can switch between different weapons, including a rifle and a pistol. Various power-ups can be collected to gain temporary advantages, such as increased firing speed, resistance to attacks, health boosts, increased bullet power, and additional ammunition. Intelligent enemies actively seek and attack the player, with two types of enemies: zombies and boss crabs. The game becomes progressively harder with each wave, and the infinite map is procedurally generated based on the player's location, with only a portion of the map being rendered within a certain radius around the player.

## Gameplay Mechanics:
Players can move in all directions using standard FPS controls, start with basic weapons, and switch between them as needed. Power-ups scattered throughout the map provide temporary boosts to help the player survive longer and defeat more enemies. Enemies include zombies, which attack in large numbers, and boss crabs, which are rare and powerful enemies that require more strategy to defeat. Each wave of enemies increases in difficulty, with more enemies and tougher challenges. The game map is infinite and procedurally generated, with only the area around the player being rendered to ensure optimal performance.
